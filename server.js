		"Money Tree": {
			"light":
				'Position your Money Tree in medium to bright indirect light, turning it every time you water it for even growth and leaf development. This plant will also adapt to low and fluorescent lights.',
			"water":
				'Your Money Tree prefers deep but infrequent watering. Water your Money Tree when the top 50%-75% of the soil is dry. Water the plant until it runs from the drainage holes and discard any excess water from the saucer. To prevent root rot, make sure your plant is never standing in water. Be sure to turn your Money Tree each time you water to allow for even growth and leaf development. Your Money Tree requires less water in the winter months when growth slows. ',
			"humidity":
				'Your Money Tree prefers a bit of extra humidity so make sure you increase the humidity in the winter months with a pebble tray or a humidifier. It will also appreciate regular misting year-round using a Mister.',
			"temperature":
				'Your Money Tree is most comfortable in temperatures between 65-80 degrees.',
			"food":
				'Feed once a month in the spring and summer when it is producing new leaves with a water-soluble, well-balanced plant food at half the recommended strength. No fertilizer is necessary during the winter when plant growth naturally slows. Always make sure the soil is damp before applying any fertilizer.',
			"toxicity":
				'Your Money Tree plant is safe for pets, according to the ASPCA.',
			"additionalInfo":
				'Try not to move your Money Tree very often, they prefer to stay in the same spot. If you do need to relocate, you may see a bit of leaf drop. Not to worry—it will adjust. If you need to trim your Money Tree, be sure to use clean, sharp Plant Snips.'

				"Water when 75% of the soil volume is dry. The leading issue with dracaenas is root rot, so keep on the dry side. Always water until you see it flow out of the drainage hole and discard the excess water in the saucer.",
			"humidity":
				"Dracaenas do well in average household humidity.",
			"temperature":
			 	"Your Dracaena will thrive in average room temperatures, between 60-80°F.",
			"food":
				"The dracaena is slow-growing and does not need much fertilizer. Feed once a month in the spring and summer with general purpose plant food, diluted to half-strength. No fertilizer is necessary during the fall and winter when plant growth naturally slows. Always make sure the soil is damp before applying any fertilizer.",
			"toxicity":
				"Dracaenas are toxic to humans and pets if ingested.",
			"additionalInfo":
				"Look out for a common problem called ‘tipping’ when the tips of the leaves dry out and turn brown. The most common cause is tap water, which contains salts, chlorine, fluoride, and other elements that may be harmful in excess. To prevent this, you can use distilled water or rainwater.",

		"Monstera": {
			"light":
				"Your Monstera can grow just about anywhere in your home! It tolerates low light, but grows faster and becomes more dramatic in a spot with indirect bright light. That said, avoid strong, direct sunlight because it may burn the leaves. If you don’t have a location with ideal lighting for your Monstera, use a Grow Light.",
			"water":
				"Water your Monstera when the top 50–75% of the soil is dry. Water until liquid flows through the drainage hole at the bottom of the pot and discard any water that has accumulated in the saucer.",
			"humidity":
				"This plant will thrive in almost any environment, but if you want to give it a special treat, gently mist it once a week using a Mister. It’s best to mist your Monstera in the morning so the water has plenty of time to evaporate before evening.",
			"temperature":
			 	"Normal room temperatures between 60–80 degrees are great for your Monstera. It will not tolerate temperatures under 55 degrees or sudden drops in temperature. Avoid cold drafts and direct airflow from heaters in the winter months.",
			"food":
				"For best results, feed your plant once a month throughout the spring and summer. A little bit of food will go a long way to encourage growth and root health. No fertilizer is necessary during the winter—it’s important to give your Monstera a chance to rest during the cooler time of year.",
			"toxicity":
				"Monstera leaves are mildly toxic to pets and humans. Typically, ingestion will cause mouth and stomach irritation and possible vomiting.",
			"additionalInfo":
				"Large leaves can collect dust. If you notice the leaves are dirty or dusty, wipe the leaves with Microfiber Dusting Gloves to keep them clean and healthy. In the wild, Monstera plants like to climb. To encourage your Monstera to climb upwards, you can stake wild offshoots with a dowel or use a moss pole. To trim your Monstera, be sure to use clean, sharp Plant Snips.",
		},
		"Peace Lily": {
