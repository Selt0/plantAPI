Water the plant until it runs from the drainage holes and discard any excess water from the saucer. To prevent root rot, make sure your plant is never standing in water. Be sure to turn your Money Tree each time you water to allow for even growth and leaf development. Your Money Tree requires less water in the winter months when growth slows. ',

    "food":
      'Feed once a month in the spring and summer when it is producing new leaves with a water-soluble, well-balanced plant food at half the recommended strength.
